# BuddyBase-Pet-Management System(Frontend Only) -
BuddyBase is a user-friendly pet management website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a touch of Python for basic scripting. It’s a frontend-only project with no backend or database, designed to simulate a real pet care platform.

The goal of BuddyBase is to create an all-in-one interface for pet lovers, adopters, and admins to interact with pet-related services. Although it’s a static website, it showcases a full range of features typically found in real-world systems.

🔑 Key Features:
👤 User & Admin Profiles – Separate dashboards with access control (simulated)

🐶 Pet Adoption Listings – View pets up for adoption with details

🍲 Pet Food & Supplements – Sections dedicated to nutrition products

🎥 Training Guides & Videos – Resources to help train pets at home

💸 Donation Page – Simulated donation interface for animal welfare

🏠 Pet Daycare – Overview and booking-style UI for pet care services

🩺 Vet Appointments & Health Tracking – Organize vet visits and monitor pet health

🚨 Animal Abuse & Rescue Alerts – Submit alerts for rescue or abuse reports

🛁 Pet Grooming Scheduler – Plan grooming sessions using a simple form-based layout

💬 Live Chat with Vets – Integrated with Tidio for real-time conversations

🔔 Notifications & Activity Tracking – Simulated user updates and logs

🎯 Project Focus:
BuddyBase emphasizes clean UI/UX design, intuitive navigation, and frontend interaction using vanilla JavaScript. All pages are static, with features visually and functionally represented using mock data and frontend logic.

This project is ideal for:

Web design/UI learners

Students building static portfolio projects

Developers looking to expand into full-stack with a strong UI base

It’s a fun, functional simulation of a modern pet care portal – all without a backend.
